# Data-Structures
Personal library of data structures, feel free to use. These will be written in Java. 

Interweaving this with Cracking the Coding Interview Questions. 

#1. Remove Dups: Write code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. 
    How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?


#2. Return Kth to Last: Implement an algorithm to find the kth to last element of a singly linked list. 

#3. Delete Middle Node: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle (i.e. any node but 
    the first and last node, not necessarily the exact middle) of a singly linked list, given only 
    access to that node. 

#4. Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all the nodess less than x come
    before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need
    to be after the elements less than x. The partition element x can appear anywhere in the 
    "right partition"; it does not need to appear brtween the left and right partiitons.
